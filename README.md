# Using Bootstrap

This repository contains a mockup of the [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/) homepage. This version of the homepage contains the featured content from June 29, 2019.

The goal when recreating this homepage was to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), which the actual Newsweek homepage also uses. The page is responsive at the Bootstrap breakpoints of **lg** (992px) and **md** (768px). The columns will adapt to accomodate the browser width according to these different breakpoints.
